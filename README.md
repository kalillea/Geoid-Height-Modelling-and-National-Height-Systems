# Geoid Height Modelling and National Height Systems

This project focuses on the modelling of geoid heights and their applications in national height systems. Utilizing Python for computational analysis, this work aims to provide insights and methodologies for accurate geoid height estimation and its significance in geodetic and surveying practices.

## Collaborators

This project was developed in collaboration with:

- Morten E.
- Tobias A.
- Peder U.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore various geoid height models and understand their impact on national height systems. Through the use of Python, we have performed a series of computations to model geoid heights accurately.
## Repository Contents
